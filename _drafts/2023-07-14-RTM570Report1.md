# Executive Summary

We provide a viable estimate of the Area of Occupancy (AOO) for any given species with an intuitive function and visualize this with a geographical mapping in RStudio. Further efforts should be made to automate data uptake/cleaning, as well as generalizing the structure of our solution to platforms outside of the RStudio environment. Additionally, careful attention should be given to the integrity of the coordinate system manipulations.

## Introduction and Background

Easy access to science-based resources is crucial for efforts to facilitate ecological diversity and conserve Oregon's natural heritage. Under this premise, the Institute for Natural Resources (INR) was established in 2001 to be "Oregon's place" - a neutral venue where anyone can engage with the most up-to-date information, tools, and data concerning natural resource and environmental conditions throughout Oregon. As such, the INR is responsible for assessing the vulnerability of rare native species throughout their natural distribution. These range within Oregon and, less frequently, bordering states. Following the methods established by NatureServe (an authoritative source for biodiversity data throughout North America), the INR can assess the vulnerability of a given species by considering many factors. One key factor is the Area of Occupancy (AOO), defined for a species as "the area within its 'extent of occurrence' (EOO), excluding areas of vagrancy"\[1\]. The latter term distinguishes AOO from EOO as a measure of occupancy, conditioned on the fact that taxon generally do not reside within the entirety of the EOO. This is typically because much of the landscape within the given EOO is either unsuitable for habitation, or simply unoccupied. EOO can be thought of as is the minimal area essential at any stage of life to the survival of a given taxon. See Figure 1.

The Oregon Biodiversity Information Center (ORBIC), based at Portland State University, is part of the INR. Working with partners from across the region, ORBIC maintains, develops and distributes the most comprehensive database of rare, threatened and endangered species in Oregon. As such, ORBIC leads the INR activities related to biodiversity and conservation in the state. Our clients, Dr. Eleanor Gaines, ORBIC Director, and Lindsey Wise, ORBIC Biodiversity Data Manager, have long been interested in conservation efforts, including assessing the vulnerability of rare species. ORBIC typically uses the aforementioned NatureServe protocol for assessing taxon vulnerability, including the AOO. To arrive at an estimate of an AOO, NatureServe often relied on the web tool GeoCat\[2\]. According to ORBIC, this method is unreliable and the viability of GeoCat currently is in question. Alternatively, INR has used GIS calculations in ArcMap (ArcGIS). However, this method of AOO estimation has proven to be excessively tedious in the cases of large ranging species.

Our team was tasked by ORBIC to determine an efficient tool to calculate an estimate of a given input's AOO across large (multi-state) ranges, with options to analyze multiple types and layers of spatial data. This tool would need to generate a 2x2 km rectangular grid to encompass the given input layer's entire spatial range and beyond. This grid would be used to calculate the number of cells which intersect any of the input layers, without counting multiple 'hits' in a single cell. In other words, if several point or polygon data describing the presence of a particular species are found to occupy a the same cell, it will be counted only once. The integer summation of these binary cell 'hits' is then converted into square kilometers, and serves as the estimated AOO of interest.

ORBIC provided access to a confidential geodatabase (.gdb) directory consisting of spatial data pertaining to observations of rare species within and around the state of Oregon. Exploration of data and implementation of methods took place exclusively in R and RStudio. However, our function is intended to be simple, intuitive, and reproducible in other environments, with varying data sources. Initial steps were taken to to clean the data. These included reading appropriate layers, and observing critical information, such as the spatial geometry, coordinate reference system (CRS), feature/field dimensions, and species types. Common fields of interest, such as date/time, spatial coordinates, projections, and common species names were concatenated into a unified spatial object. We then determined the best way to plot these data onto an interpretable map. It was discovered that our final mapping needs to cover most of the area of the US West Coast states. See Figure 2.

```

Once we gained command of the spatial data, we developed methods to construct our grid system. We found the most success by building a raster object ourselves from previously determined variables, such as coordinate limits and cell sizes. Essentially, a raster object in R acts as a matrix-like grid system that can overlay onto a map. The grid evenly consists of spatially-oriented cells that can be populated with user-determined values. Our method involved coordinating the provided species/time/location data with our raster object, and populating the associated cells with 1s where the data overlap and 0s otherwise. Once this is accomplished, we can then simply convert this sum of 1s into square kms, and arrive at an estimate for the AOO.

## The Data

### Data Description

These data come from several autonomous sources with common interests in conservation. All of these sources are considered reliable and abide by science-driven standards. The spatial data provided by ORBIC were separated into 7 distinct data sources directories; 

1. Biotics - NatureServe Biotics 5 taxonomic and biological database. 
2. BLM - Bureau of Land Management data pertaining to Oregon and Washington. 
3. iNaturalist - a free application used by professionals and amateurs alike to record observations in the field. 
4. ODFW - Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife database. 
5. OregonFlora - data collected in the field by scientists and amateurs through a wildflower identification app. 
6. PODs - Point Observational Database managed by ORBIC at OSU. 
7. USFW - US Fish and Wildlife database pertaining to Oregon and neighboring states.

From these sources, there were a total of 10 .gbd files, each equipped with a single layer.

There are six Oregon species in these data known commonly as the 

* Oregon Spotted frog 
* Southern torrent salamander
* White-headed woodpecker 
* Miller Lake lamprey 
* Tricolor Monkeyflower 
* Khrusea (or Small TwistedStock).

```


### Distinctions of Spatial Data

It is useful to note some distinction in terminology concerning spatial data - 'features' are what most data scientists would call observations or rows, with both spatial and non-spatial 'fields' (variables or columns) associated with each feature. All 10 .gbd files were unique, having varying numbers of features (4 - 6000+) and fields (40-200+), different spatial geometries - point, multipolygon, or multilinearstring, as well as differing CRSs - NAD83 and WSG84, and coordinate projections - long/lat vs. eastings/northings. It was discovered that many of the fields, mostly those outside of our interest, were riddled with missing values. However, every feature of the 15,129 total had a geometry, CRS, projection, and species name associated with it. Date/time contained many NA values, but we incorporated these into our data regardless. These were the primary fields of concern for our study. Additionally, we referenced the data source from which each feature came.

Our team found it was particularly important to pay attention to the CRS and projection settings of a given data set. Projections and coordinate reference systems in spatial data refer to the various methods used to mathematically project spherical data (the globe) onto a two-dimensional map. The accuracy of these systems depends on particular geographic origins, measurement scales and angles used. There are dozens in common use, depending on the area of the world in which one is located \[2,5,6\]. Unfortunately, these CRSs seem to rarely communicate well with each other, and errors in translating from one type to another can result in relatively gross inaccuracies when mapping. Our data were in varying combinations of CRSs (NAD83/Oregon Lambert and WSG84) and resultant geographic projections (longitude/latitude in degrees or UTM eastings/northings in feet). With the goal of 'NAD83' as the common projection in our data, our team carefully navigating through subtle details of standardizing our geographic projection accordingly.

It is also important to identify and understand a spatial data frame layer's geometry. Simultaneously a visual and mathematical concept, it is common to think of data geometries as the best 'symbols' representing our features. For instance, a single Monkeyflower is observed in a precise coordinate location and can be represented as occupying a 'point'. Whereas our Miller Lake lamprey is observed in a lake which has width and breadth. A 'polygon' is used to represent a feature such as a lake and hence the occupation of the lamprey. Our data primarily contains 'point' geometries. It also contains 'polygon', and 'linestring' data. Linestring geometries can be thought of as representing a path or narrow river. Mathematically, the geometries of a given data set are stored as vectors of paired geographic coordinates\[5\]. Refer to Figure 4. 

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.cap='Visualizing Geometries',fig.pos='h',out.width='75%',fig.height=8}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/travismerrill/Desktop/HOMEWORK/2023/SPRING2023/570/Project1/Report/images/mapgeom.png')
```
We succincly summarize the data below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
my_matrix3 <- matrix(c("Biotics", 276, 49, "Polygon", "NAD83", 
                     "BLM(OR)", 626,48,"Point",
                     'NAD83',"BLM(Wa)",4, 48, "Point", "NAD83",
                     "iNaturalist", 476, 259, "Point", "WSG84",
                     "ODFW", 18, 29, "LineString", "NAD83",
                     "OrFlora(Strep)",90, 96,"Point", "WSG84",

                     byrow = T, ncol = 5);


colnames(my_matrix3) <- c("Source", "Features","Fields","Geometry", "Projected CRS");
rownames(my_matrix3) <- c(rep("", 10))

gt(as.data.frame(my_matrix3)) %>% cols_align(align = "center")
```

## Methods

First, it is worth discussing some of the consequences of the inherent structural differences between a spatial data frame, and a conventional data frame in R. For instance, common packages for wrangling data frames, such as 'dplyr' and 'tidyverse', are not equipped to appropriately handle geographical coordinate systems, nor spatial data geometries\[2\].  Additionally, these common packages were not found to have convenient methods to pull layers from GDB files. Similar precautions should be taken with the following methods in other common statistical software and programming languages. 

Our team's methods primarily revolved around processing, manipulating, and visualizing spatial data frames, as well as engineering a flexible raster object directly associated with the geospatial properties of the input data. Ultimately, we wish to arrive at a simple function that intakes a .shp or set of .shp files and outputs a regional grid system to display where species data are occupying raster cells. This output will be coupled with an estimate of the AOO for each species. Please note that this section is heavily references the Source Code section of this paper.  

### Initial Steps

Our initial steps were to tidy and concatenate the several individual data sets into a single understandable spatial data object. This process involved removing quite a bit of extraneous fields from each file, including many missing values. Some challenges arose when deciphering labels of certain fields. However, this ultimately had a negligible effect on the values of interest for this study. For future exploration, we may recommend developing an algorithm to automate this process, or perhaps abiding by a standard protocol when entering data for the .shp file. It is worth mentioning that the remaining variable of 'date' contained an abundance of missing values.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
my_matrix <- matrix(c("Point", "Polygon","LineString", 7640,7489,18,3981,18,18),
                    byrow = F, nrow = 3);
colnames(my_matrix) <- c("Geometry", "#Obs", "#NAs in date");
rownames(my_matrix) <- c(rep("",3));
gt(as.data.frame(my_matrix)) %>% cols_align(align = "center")
```

### Data Visualization and Manipulation with R

After we wrangled the data into a unified .shp object, we organized an effective method to easily plot our spatial data, with its varying geometries, onto an interpretable map of the region on interest. For our initial purposes, this was best accomplished using the "maps" package, which is an invaluable source of geospatial data available in R which allows for simple specifications of states and countries. Outputs from the **map()** function are easily converted into spatial data frames, and work nicely within an intuitive **ggplot()** environment. Based on the client-suggested geographic range of this study, and the observed range of species distribution, we found our final map to cover the states on the US West Coast, as well as western Idaho and parts of western Canada. This allowed us to confirm the geospatial specifications for the raster object that follows in a few more steps. See Figure 2 and refer to the Source Code: Reading and Plotting the Data.

Another essential package we utilize is **sf()** (simple features). This is a recently updated package for R, designed specifically to deal with geodatabase and other spatial data types. Of particular use within this package was the **st_coordinates()** function which conveniently creates an array of all the specific coordinates associated with a .gdb or .shp file. In this way, the pertinent geographic coordinate information can be easily pulled and concatenated or converted into other .gdbs or .shp files. We utilized this frequently when attempting to 'standardize' the given coordinate projections within our .shp files. Please refer to Source Code: Projections and Coordinates in R, Source Code: Data Concatenation, and Source Code: SHP files. 

### Creating a Geographic Grid System

So far, our team has established effective methods to concatenate and visualize the data in a meaningful way in accordance with geometric and coordinate attributes. Now, we engineer our raster object. Here, our raster will function as the foundation for the 2x2 square km grid with which we estimate values of specified AOOs. The dimensions and resolution of this raster were specified by ORBIC and interpreted by our CADES team. Ultimately we found success by creating a raster from scratch, following the provided guidelines as strictly as possible. Using the **raster()** function from the **terra()** package, we construct a pixelated raster object with cells of 4 square kilometers (2x2 km) that correspond to the geospatial coordinates and projections. The raster resolution was in accordance with these given measures and resulted in 963,033 cells. Refer to Source Code: Assembling the Raster. 

Finally, these cells were populated based on whether specified location features of our data overlap within these spaces. Populating the raster with the corresponding spatial data was a bit trickier, and requires a bit of finesse using the **rasterize(SpatialPointsobject,raster)** function and careful formatting of objects. As mentioned in the introduction, if and when multiple features are present within the same cell, a count will only be given once. Hence, we populate our raster cells in a binary fashion with 1s where any number of species are present and 0s otherwise. It is then straightforward to sum these cell values and convert this information back into square kilometers. We arrive at our estimate of the user-specified AOO. By layering maps and raster plots, we arrive at an easily interpretable visualization of the AOO determined. Please refer to Figure 1 and Source Code: Assembling the Raster. 

The results are as follows:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
my_matrix2 <- matrix(c("OR Spotted Frog", 358, 1432, "Small TwistedStock", 106, 424, 
                       "So. Torrent Salamander", 470,1880,"Tri-Colored MonkeyFlower",117,468,"Miller Lake Lamprey",167,668,"White-headed Woodpecker",786,3144), byrow = T, ncol = 3);
colnames(my_matrix2) <- c("Species", "Total Cells", "Estimated AOO (km^2)");
rownames(my_matrix2) <- c(rep("",6))
gt(as.data.frame(my_matrix2)) %>% cols_align(align = "center") %>% tab_options(table.width = '50%')
```

### Workflow into the Developed Function

Our team automated this process with a function. The following is a workflow demonstrating how one effectively utilizes the provided function. 

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.cap='Workflow for Function Use',fig.pos='h',out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/travismerrill/Desktop/HOMEWORK/2023/SPRING2023/570/Project1/Report/images/workflow.png')
```

We will briefly summarize the process up to the function, as many of the details have been described already. We being by manually cleaning our raw spatial data, pulling the desired variables, and concatenating into .shp files. As of now, the reference grid (raster) system is determined outside of the function, either by the user, or from the bounding box information present in the data. Once these items are appropriately prepared, they are inputted into the function. The output is a series of summary tables and raster plots to visualize species occupation. Each species is granted a plot and a table. Examine Figure 6 and 7. 

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.cap=c('Function Output: Raster Plot', 'Function Output: Summary Tables'),fig.pos='h',out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c('/Users/travismerrill/Desktop/HOMEWORK/2023/SPRING2023/570/Project1/Report/images/funout.png','/Users/travismerrill/Desktop/HOMEWORK/2023/SPRING2023/570/Project1/Report/images/funout2.png'))
```

The function our team developed operates in a relatively straight forward manner, and follows almost exactly with the methods developed so far. This function intakes .shp files - in our case, we are using three .shp files, one for each geometry type present. It then pulls the spatial coordinate information from each shape file and associates these with the pre-defined raster object. This results in three rasters, which are concatenated into a single raster. The cells of this final raster are then populated according to a binary variable directly related to species occupation. The function's output is a summary of each species' cell count and estimated AOO, along with a plot of the raster to aide in visualizing occupation. In total, the output results in six plots, and six summary tables, one for each species. Please refer to Figure 7 and 8, and Source Code: The Function. A valuable tool ORBIC may consider for future applications of this function is R-ArcGIS Bridge. This is a software that allows easy access to ArcGIS data and brings it into R for specialized statistical analysis\[7\]. Hence, the function we developed in R can be directly applied to ArcGIS data. 

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Methods for effectively handling spatial data exist in convenient statistical software and programming languages, such as R. Often, strategies invoked in these environments can circumvent the inefficiencies and tedious coding required in other GIS-centric approaches, such as GeoCat and ArcMap. There are also robust online communities available for trouble-shooting and research concerning spatial data within the framework of R (or other software). Our team was tasked with developing an intuitive and effective function that takes in spatial data related to species distribution, and outputs a 2x2 square kilometer geographic grid system to visualize and estimate the value of a specified Area of Occupancy. We believe our team has prepared a satisfactory first-generation functional solution to the given problem at hand. Our function takes a simply structured spatial data frame, along with a pre-defined rasterized grid system, and outputs a visualization of species distribution and AOO.

We would like to emphasize that this is only an initial solution. Further efforts need to be taken to generalize several facets of this function. The function operates on data pertaining to the .shp files which were formatted beforehand in a precise manner. Future efforts will be taken to efficiently take in more generalized spatial data structures, and expand the range of parameters. 

Finally, we would like to thank Dr. Eleanor Gaines, Lindsey Wise, and the entire ORBIC division of the INR for allowing our team this opportunity. It was an enlightening experience that served to enrich our understanding of spatial data and GIS.

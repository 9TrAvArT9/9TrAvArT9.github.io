## What is Bootstrapping?
<br>
We are all familiar with the simple, yet tremendously useful, characteristics that analysts commonly seek to extract from a data set. These include the mean, median, standard deviation, and many other fundamental descriptive statistics that, when taken alone, can divulge tremendously useful information about the distribution and behavior of our data. Just as importantly, these statistics and the information they harness form the basis of hypothesis testing and more complicated statistical models. Often when we formulate conclusions and develop more refined models based on these useful statistics, we are making profound assumptions without realizing it. 

At its heart, bootstrapping is an alternative to mathematically derived sampling distributions.

During my many years tutoring statistics, many of my students were Ecology, Psychology or Social Sciences majors struggling to make it through their required basic Statistics courses. However, more often than not, I found my students weren't really learning statistics in their Statistics courses. Instead, they were learning a systematic algorithm to solve homework and test questions. When approached with a familiar problem, I discovered most of my clients simply identified the *type* of problem at hand and then followed a step-wise formula to the appropriate answer. For example, suppose a student is presented with sample data and asked to calculate the 95% confidence interval of the sample mean. Most students would identify this as a 'sample mean CI' type of question, and simply calculate the mean and variance to plug into a formula, where they arrive at the correct answer. 'A' leads to 'B' leads to 'C', etc, in this linear solution pathway. 

Although this somewhat algorithmic approach to Statistics homework and test problems is effective at guiding novice students to the correct solution space, the opportunity for generalizing these concepts to gain a deeper understanding of underlying notions is all but lost. In the example metnioned above, it is never asked *why* we used that particular formula, *how* confidence intervals work in other situations, and *what* assumptions are being made to even use these in the first place. Indeed, when presented with variations of familiar problems, the formulaic approach tends to fail to lead them to the answer. A big problem arises when these students become scientists with only basic Statistical education whom design and analyze their own experiments. In the real-world setting, many of the requirements and assumptions, previously taken for granted in their Introductory Statistics classes, fail to be satisfied, and conclusions made from these experiments are ultimately unfounded.

In my years of tutoring statistics, I found most of my students were Psychology or Social Sciences majors struggling to make it through their required basic statistics courses. I always tried to convey the motives of what they were learning, or put some of these novel and, often abstract, statistical concepts into some familiar context. However, when it came down to taking exams and answering homework questions, often we were best served to simply classify the problem at hand and follow a formulaic path to the appropriate solution. For example, a student is presented with data from two distinct sample populations, and asked to determine if there is a significant difference between their respective means. We identify there are two samples from different subjects, and that we are dealing with the mean. Hence, a two-sample t-test is identified as the correct solution path, and the student gets the correct answer - 'NO', we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the samples, and conclude there is no significant difference in the population. 'A' leads to 'B' leads to 'C', etc, in this, and most, solution pathways. 

Although this algorithmic approach to homework is efficient and effective at guiding novice students to the correct solution space, the opportunity for generalizing these concepts to gain a deeper understanding of underlying notions is lost. These all-to-common methods are endorsed by tutors and teachers alike, and for seemingly good reason - they are easy to understand and boost students' confidence as they are often led to the correct answers. However, many of these aforementioned

<p>Currently, I am a full-time graduate student at Portland State University. Most of my time is devoted to 
    studying Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, and Data Science. In June 2023, I will complete my MS in 
    Statistics. Although I relish dedicating my energy to academia, I'm excited to aim my focus towards a meaningful 
    career. 
</p>

<p>Real-world data can present novel challenges to even the most experienced analyst. Solutions to these problems often call upon
    cutting edge methods in machine learning and advanced mathematical theory. Data analysis and related fields have ever-evolving needs.
    Because of this, Data Scientists, Statisticians, and many other professionals commit themselves to a lifetime of learning. 
    To me, this is the best part about a career in statistics/machine-learning - my education will never truly cease. Due 
    to this, I have found a comfortable and satisfying place in the feilds of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. 
    This is what inspired me to build this website and what motivates me to write posts on a wide range of topics in these 
    fields. 
</p>

<p>Hopefully this hasn't made me seem too serious. Despite my commitment to learning, I'm a very fun-loving person. 
    Playing and writing music has been and will always be an important part of my life. In fact, before I discovered my
    love of mathematics, I had pursued a music career for many years. I am also deeply passionate about rescue dogs. 
    I have been volunteering with a few great organizations for several years. Whether its fostering pups, transporting
    dogs to new homes, or flying out of the country deliver puppies back, I find great joy in helping them find good homes.

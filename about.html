<p>Currently, I am a full-time graduate student at Portland State University. Most of my time is devoted to 
    studying Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, and Data Science. In June 2023, I will complete my MS in 
    Statistics. Although I relish dedicating my energy to academia, I'm excited to gear my focus towards a meaningful 
    career.

<p>Another thing </p>
